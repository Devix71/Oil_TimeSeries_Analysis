In this folder are 2 Jupyter Notebooks.
The first one, Crude_Oil.ipynb shows that the CrudeOil's time series is non-stationary without differencing
and tries to model it's future evolution through SARIMA. This is needed for the cointegration in the next notebook,
as it must be shown that the series is non-stationary before using it.

The second one, RetailPrice.ipynb is the main analysis, as it shows how much the price of crude oil impacts the price
of retail fuel and it also models the future evolution of retail fuel prices based on the crude oil price.
